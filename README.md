LaTeXTalk
=========

This repository is my latex/[beamer](http://ctan.org/pkg/beamer) talk template.
I don't suppose it's really that useful for anyone else but me.
It's useful to just clone this for every new talk.

If you reeeeeally want to, you're welcome to clone and tweak to your own needs.
Basically [go nuts, and share alike](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).
The [LHCb](https://cds.cern.ch/record/1260132) and [Imperial](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/graphicidentity/applyingthegraphicidentity/usingthelogo) logos have usage restrictions. 
So don't use them if you shouldn't.
Replace the logos in `front/title.tex`.
