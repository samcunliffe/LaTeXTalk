LaTeXTalk
=========

This repository is my latex/[beamer](http://ctan.org/pkg/beamer) talk template.
I don't suppose it's really that useful for anyone else but me.
Buuut anyone who really wants to is welcome to clone and tweak to their own needs.
For me, it's useful to just clone this for every new talk.

The LHCb and Imperial logos have usage restrictions. 
So don't use them if you shouldn't.
Replace the logos in `frontmatter/titlepage.tex`.
